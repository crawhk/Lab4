### Load packages and data


```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox) 
```

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

> What are the dimensions of the Denny’s dataset? (Hint: Use inline R code and functions like nrow and ncol to compose your answer.) What does each row in the dataset represent? What are the variables?

Denny's Data:
1,643 Rows - observations (i.e., dennys locations)  

6 columns - variables (address, city, state, zip, longitude, latitude)

```{r}
glimpse(dennys)
```

### Exercise 2
> What are the dimensions of the La Quinta’s dataset? What does each row in the dataset represent? What are the variables?  

LaQuinta Data
909 Rows - observations (i.e., la qunitas locations)  

6 columns - varaibles (address, city, state, zip, longitude, latitude)

```{r}
glimpse(laquinta)
```
```{r}
laquinta %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  arrange(n)
```


### Exercise 3
> Take a look at the websites that the data come from (linked above). Are there any La Quinta’s locations outside of the US? If so, which countries? What about Denny’s?  

Yes, there are La Quinta's locations outside of the US --> Canada, Mexico, China, New Zealand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador

The current Dennys data set only includes US states, although Google says Denny's has now expanded globally. 

```{r}
select(states)
```

### Exercise 4

> Now take a look at the data. What would be some ways of determining whether or not either establishment has any locations outside the US using just the data (and not the websites). Don’t worry about whether you know how to implement this, just brainstorm some ideas. Write down at least one as your answer, but you’re welcomed to write down a few options too.
- looking at number of states and longitude/latitude 

### Exercise 5

> Find the Denny’s locations that are outside the US, if any. To do so, filter the Denny’s locations for observations where state is not in "states$abbreviation." 

> The code for this is given below. Note that the "%in%" operator matches the states listed in the state variable to those listed in "states$abbreviation". The ! operator means not. Are there any Denny’s locations outside the US?

```{r}
dennys %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
```

### Exercise 6
> Add a country variable to the Denny’s dataset and set all observations equal to "United States". Remember, you can use the mutate function for adding a variable. Make sure to save the result of this as dn again so that the stored data frame contains the new variable going forward.

```{r}
dennysus <- dennys %>%
  mutate(country = "United States")

```

### Exercise 7
> Find the La Quinta locations that are outside the US, and figure out which country they are in. This might require some googling. Take notes, you will need to use this information in the next exercise.

- Canada, Mexico, China, New Zealand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador, Honduras

### Exercise 8
> Add a country variable to the La Quinta dataset. Use the case_when function to populate this variable. You’ll need to refer to your notes from Exercise 7 about which country the non-US locations are in. Here is some starter code to get you going:

```{r}
laquinta %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
```
Mexico (AG, QR, CH, NL, VE, PU, SL), Columbia (ANT), Canada (ON, BC), Honduras (FM)


```{r}
laquintacountry <- laquinta %>% 
  mutate(country = case_when(
    state %in% state.abb ~ "United States",
    state %in% c("ON", "BC") ~ "Canada",
    state == "ANT" ~ "Colombia",
    state %in% c("AG", "QR", "CH", "NL", "VE", "PU", "SL") ~ "Mexico",
    state == "FM" ~ "Honduras"))
```

```{r}
laquinta_us <- laquintacountry %>%
  filter(country == "United States")
```

### Exercise 9
> Which states have the most and fewest Denny’s locations? What about La Quinta? Is this surprising? Why or why not?

- most Dennys: California
- fewest Dennys: Deleware

- most La Quintas: Texas
- fewest La Quintas: Maine

Not surprised by results 

```{r}
dennysus %>%
  count(state) %>%
  inner_join(states, by = c("state" = "abbreviation")) %>%  
  arrange(n)

```
```{r}
laquinta_us %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  arrange(n)

```


### Exercise 10
> Which states have the most Denny’s locations per thousand square miles? What about La Quinta?
 
```{r}
usd_est <- dennysus %>%
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")
uslq_est <- laquinta_us %>%
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")
```
 
```{r}
dn_lq <- bind_rows(usd_est, uslq_est)
```

 
```{r}
ggplot(dn_lq, mapping = aes(
  x = longitude,
  y = latitude,
  color = establishment
)) +
  geom_point()
```
 
### Exercise 11
> Filter the data for observations in North Carolina only, and recreate the plot. You should also adjust the transparency of the points, by setting the alpha level, so that it’s easier to see the overplotted ones. Visually, does Mitch Hedberg’s joke appear to hold here?

```{r}
dn_lq_nc <- dn_lq %>% 
  filter(state == "NC")
```

```{r}
ggplot(dn_lq_nc, mapping = aes(
  x = longitude,
  y = latitude,
  color = establishment
)) +
  geom_point(alpha =.50) + labs(title = "Does La Quinta = By a Denny's in NC?")

```

While there are many more Denny's than La Quintas - it does appear that all but one La Quintas has a Denny's closeby... seems suspicious 


### Exercise 12
>Now filter the data for observations in Texas only, and recreate the plot, with an appropriate alpha level. Visually, does Mitch Hedberg’s joke appear to hold here? 

```{r}
dn_lq_tx <- dn_lq %>% 
  filter(state == "TX")
```

```{r}
ggplot(dn_lq_tx, mapping = aes(
  x = longitude,
  y = latitude,
  color = establishment
)) +
  geom_point(alpha =.20) + labs(title = "Does La Quinta = By a Denny's in TX?")

```

If you are at a la quintas in TX -- you are very likely to find a Dennys near by but since the la quintas overpower the dennys in terms of numbers it is not one to one
